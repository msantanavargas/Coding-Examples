# Code Examples of my Work
Repository of some samples of my code for different languages I work on.

So far the repository includes:

1. Code for Apple Hardware, mainly in [Swift](https://github.com/msantanavargas/Coding-Examples/tree/main/Apple)
   - MacOS, iOS and WatchOS
   - Examples of Computer Graphics with high performance, including multithreading, Network logic, as well as data manipulation and transformations
2. High performance code, mainly in [C/C++](https://github.com/msantanavargas/Coding-Examples/tree/main/C)
   - High performance Computer Graphics code to run in Vulkan
   - Vulkan is Hardware independent so the code runs on AMD and nVidia cards. Vulkan is very unforgiving with the programmer, and it expects everything to be done explicitly. Examples include setting up the graphics pipeline, multithreading and memory handling. 
3. High level language coding examples in [Python](https://github.com/msantanavargas/Coding-Examples/tree/main/Python)
   - This includes Scripting, data manipulation, data science, infrastructure and artificial intelligence.
4. Code for infrastructure. I worked with containers and cloud computing mainly with [AWS](https://github.com/msantanavargas/Coding-Examples/tree/main/AWS)
   - Mainly scripting in Bash on how to get some services in AWS working.
