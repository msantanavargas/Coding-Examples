# Python

This section of my repository contains examples for Python.

As Python is quite varied, I have included examples across many different areas. 

If you are interested in code that is speedy and has high performance, you should check C/C++ instead. This code is more high level, but vcaries from data handling, to data classification up to artificial intelligence.
