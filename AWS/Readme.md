# Amazon Web Services

Scripts and Utilities to get services going. This assumes there is nothing set up.

1. Create an AWS Ubuntu 24.04 Instance through the AWS Instances Dash.
2. [Bash Script](https://github.com/msantanavargas/Coding-Examples/blob/main/AWS/docker_install.sh) to install Docker in an Ubuntu 24.04 AWS Instance. This should only be run once, when the instance is created. Should be run as root.
